# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview
This project visually presents the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

Each earthquake will be represented as a circle on a map.  The circles will be larger and darker in color as the magnitude of the earthquake it represents is greater.
